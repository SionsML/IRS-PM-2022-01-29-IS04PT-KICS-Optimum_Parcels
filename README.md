## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
---
Over the last two years, the demand for courier services has risen significantly because of the threat of the Covid-19 pandemic. Community quarantines, work from home and online classes due to the pandemic have pushed people all over the world to resort to the use of courier services to buy their needs and essentials. Courier services play an immense role in offering a safe yet convenient method for acquiring necessities and wants during the pandemic. And this fluctuation of the pandemic and the way it influences our shopping habits will likely continue in the foreseeable future. Unpredictable spikes in virus cases in certain geographies may temporarily accelerate online orders and the need for home delivery from time-to-time.

For consumers who wish to send and receive parcels, it can be quite challenging and confusing to decide which shipping company to select that would suit their specific needs and requirements. As the competition in this industry heats up, we notice an almost daily increase in the number of logistics companies available for consumers to choose from. This further adds to the consumersâ€™ confusion and makes the process of selecting the most suitable shipping service very time-consuming and complicated.

We plan to address this issue by creating an intelligent reasoning system that can ease these pain-points for consumers. Our system would help the users determine the weight and dimensions of their package in a simple manner, and then provide them with an interface to compare the shipping services best suited to their needs. The system would also consider some user preferences inputs, such as cost or time sensitivity, to accordingly recommend services that are the most economical or the fastest.
